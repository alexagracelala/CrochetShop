# Originally planned: I was going to just have a "blog" of pictures of my crochet projects with descriptions. 
# Delivered: I ended up doing my future plans where I made a shop, cart, and checkout page where you could purchase my crochet projects. 
# If I had more time I would learn PHP so that it could be functional.
