            <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>My name is Alexa Grace LaFontaine-Larson, and I am a 19-year-old girl from Woodbury, Minnesota. 
            I have two 30-year-old sisters who are twins, and a little brother named Landon who just turned 10! 
            I am a freshman at Lewis University where I am studying Computer Science. 
            I love to read, play video games, thrift, and, of course, crochet.
            In the picture is my lovely boyfriend and my brother.</p>

            <h1>My Crochet Journey</h1>
        <p>I first started to learn how to crochet with my mother when I was 11-years-old. 
            We went to classes at our local Joann's Fabric to learn both crocheting and knitting. 
            Crocheting definitely stuck more than knitting, 
            and I have had an on-again, off-again relationship with crocheting throughout my life. 
            Going to college away from home reignited my desire and passion for Crocheting. 
            I have gotten to a level I never once was and enjoy it more than ever.</p>
